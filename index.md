# Welcome to my blog

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about my exciting journey of becoming a **Web Developer**! 

After seeing a lack of diversity, (especially a lack of women in STEM), I decided to leave my job of almost 6 years in Commercial Real Estate and apply to Lambda School's Computer Science Program. I'm a firm believer in being part of the change you want to see in the world, so this mixed in with a few other things played a big part in motivating me to make this career change. I was accepted and enrolled into their cohort, CS9 and began my coursework in early March. After six intense months of pair programming, lectures, studying, creaeting projects daily and wrapping up with a 3 week Capstone Project, I made it to graduation! 

This was a *huge accomplishment* for me because I decided to leave the Real Estate Industry I had worked so hard in for well over a decade in order to make this leap into an industry I was passionate about. After all, if it weren't for technology, I never would have met my husband *(yahoo chat)*, but I'll save that for another blog post!

Now time to keep creating projects for my [portfolio](https://kaitlynflynn.com/) and continue the job hunt!
